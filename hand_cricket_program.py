print('''Hello guys ! Let's know the rules !
      First u will input your balls for each team.
      This is to set the length of ur game.
      Wickets will be balls//6 + 1.
      Eg: 25 balls -> 25//6+ 1 -> 4+1 ->5
      Second u will input your opponent's and your team name.
      Read whether you will be batting or bowling first.
      Bowling:
          U will type a number from 0 to 6 as input.
          If your symbol matches with the computer's symbol,
          you will get a wicket. If u get all of them, computer will be all out.
          If they don't match, the symbol computer enters will add up in its' runs tally.
          If you are bowling second, restrict the computer from reaching your runs scored in the 1st innings, to win.
      Batting:
          U will type a number from 0 to 6 as input.
          If your symbol matches with computer's symbol, you will lose a wicket.
          Remember you have only 5 of them.
          If they don't match, the symbol you enter will be assed in your runs tally.
          If batting second, score more than what the computer scored in the first innings, to win'
      If your score and the computer's scores are level at the end of the game, it is a TIE.
      Alert: Do not enter number less than 0 or greater than 6. Else it  will show Invalid Input.
      HAVE A NICE TIME !!! ðŸ¤—'
